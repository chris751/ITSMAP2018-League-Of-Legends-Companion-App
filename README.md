# Application vision 

The  app  is  supposed  to  act  as  companion  while  playing  the  game  League  ofLegends.  Information that the player could want is available in the app.  Theapp displays valuable information about the current game that the player is in.This includes an overview of your teammates and your opponents.  The user cannow view more detailed information about your lane opponent.  Such as howmany games they have played on their picked champion,  k/d ratio,  rank andother information that might be relevant.The app solves the problem of having no prior insight in the players that youare playing with and against.  Current solution are typically web applicationsthat would require users with only a single monitor to tab out of a game andenter player information which is not desirable in a competitive game.The app has an “In Game” mode for when the player is in a game and a “OutOf Game” mode for when not playing.  Each of these modes display differentinformation that is relevant for the actual context.The Out Of Game mode displays relevant data for the current game, whilethe passive mode shows game stats/history/level/progress and so on.  Further-more  following  friends  activities  in  the  app,  and  receiving  notifications  whenthey enter a game, could also be possible.
